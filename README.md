# **DeepClassifer** 
DeepClassifier is a python package based on pytorch, which is easy-use and general for text classification task. You can install DeepClassifier by `pip install -U deepclassifier`„ÄÇ
If you want to know more information about DeepClassifier, please see the [**documentation**](https://deepclassifier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). So let's start!ü§©
> If you think DeepClassifier is good, please star and fork it to give me motivation to continue maintenanceÔºÅü§© And it's my pleasure that if Deepclassifier is helpful to you!ü•∞

## **installation**
Just like other Python packages, DeepClassifier also can be installed through pip.The command of installation is `pip install -U deepclassifier`.
## **Models**
Here is a list of models that have been integrated into DeepClassifier. In the future, we will integrate more models into DeepClassifier. Welcome to join us!ü§©
